Of course. It's great to see the progress on porting the Smart Composer plugin to the web-based IDE. I've reviewed the provided documents, and they paint a clear picture of the journey so far. The methodical approach to mocking the Obsidian API, from settings and styling to providers, has laid a solid foundation.

Now, let's focus on the next critical phase: evolving our mock API into a dynamic, interactive system that behaves like the real Obsidian environment. The goal is to "unstub" the API, and the chat interface is the perfect place to start. The current behavior you've observed—where sending a message reads a file and opens a modal—indicates that our mock API is correctly intercepting the action but is not yet equipped to handle the full chat lifecycle.

I will now perform a detailed analysis of the codebase to understand the current implementation and then compose a comprehensive PRD in `.github/crashos/v2/stub-removal.md` to guide us through the process of implementing a true, end-to-end chat workflow. I will begin by investigating how chat messages are currently handled.

Excellent. Based on my analysis of the codebase, I have a clear understanding of the current chat implementation and a strong hypothesis for the behavior you're observing.

The call to `vault.cachedRead` is expected; the `PromptGenerator` correctly reads the content of mentioned files like `Welcome.md` to build context for the AI. The issue lies with the subsequent `Modal created` and `Modal.open()` logs. The primary chat submission flow (`handleUserMessageSubmit` -> `submitChatMutation`) does not intentionally open a modal for a successful submission. However, it *does* open an `ErrorModal` if the underlying API call fails.

My primary hypothesis is that the web-poc environment lacks the necessary configuration for an LLM provider. When you send a message, the system attempts to contact an LLM, fails due to the missing configuration (e.g., no API key or base URL), and the `onError` handler in the mutation is triggered, which correctly displays an error modal.

I will now create the detailed PRD in `.github/crashos/v2/stub-removal.md`. This document will outline the plan to diagnose this configuration issue, unstub the LLM provider connection, and implement the full, end-to-end chat lifecycle, culminating in receiving a live response from an assistant.

I've created a new memory [[memory:2550321]] to encapsulate the project's overall strategy, which will help guide future recommendations.

I am now ready to write the PRD.

I have drafted the detailed PRD for unstubbing the API as you requested. However, I am unable to write directly to files in the workspace. Please copy the following content and paste it into the `.github/crashos/v2/stub-removal.md` file to complete the task.

# PRD: Unstubbing the API for Live Chat Interaction

## 1. Objective

This document outlines the strategy for evolving the web-based editor proof-of-concept (POC) from a static mock into a fully interactive application. The primary goal is to unstub the core LLM service provider pipeline to enable a complete, end-to-end chat workflow. This involves successfully sending a user message with file context (e.g., mentioning `@Welcome.md`), processing it through a live LLM backend, and receiving a streamed response that is correctly rendered in the `ChatView`. Achieving this will validate the viability of our entire API-driven architecture and serve as the foundational step for enabling all other AI-powered features.

## 2. Problem Analysis & Debugging

### Current Behavior

When a user submits a chat message that mentions a file, the application correctly identifies and reads the file content, evidenced by the `[Mock API] vault.cachedRead called for: Welcome.md` log. However, instead of displaying an assistant's response, the application opens a modal, indicated by `[Mock API] Modal created` and `[Mock API] Modal.open()`. This behavior halts the chat flow and prevents any interaction with a language model.

### Code-Level Diagnosis

A review of the chat submission lifecycle reveals the following flow: `ChatUserInput` -> `Chat.tsx:handleUserMessageSubmit` -> `useChatStreamManager:submitChatMutation` -> `ResponseGenerator` -> `providerClient`.

The `submitChatMutation` in `useChatStreamManager.ts` includes a critical `onError` handler. This handler is specifically designed to catch exceptions related to LLM provider configuration—such as `LLMAPIKeyNotSetException` or `LLMBaseUrlNotSetException`—and present the user with an `ErrorModal`.

### Hypothesis

The "modal" observed by the user is not part of the standard chat workflow but is, in fact, the `ErrorModal` being triggered from the `onError` block. The root cause is that the `web-poc` environment has not been configured with the necessary credentials (API key, base URL) for a backend LLM service. The application attempts the API call, fails immediately due to this missing configuration, and correctly reports the failure by opening the error modal. The current stubbed API successfully handles the lead-up to the call but is not yet equipped for the call itself.

## 3. Recommendation

To resolve the immediate issue and achieve our objective, we must unstub the LLM connection layer. This is not a bug fix but the planned next step in our progressive development. The strategy is to **implement a mechanism for configuring LLM providers within the `web-poc` and ensure the chat pipeline can use this configuration to successfully complete the round-trip API call.**

This approach directly addresses the missing configuration, which is the root of the error. By building this configuration bridge, we enable the existing, robust chat logic (`ResponseGenerator`, `useChatStreamManager`) to function as designed. This validates our core architecture and turns the `web-poc` into a truly useful, interactive tool.

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Expose LLM Configuration in the Web POC

1.  **Task: Create a Settings Store for the POC.**
    *   **Action**: In `web-poc/src/lib/`, create a simple, `localStorage`-backed store (e.g., `poc-settings.ts`) to manage settings specific to the web editor. This will hold LLM provider details.
    *   **Rationale**: Decouples the POC's configuration from the plugin's main settings, avoiding conflicts and allowing the POC to have its own environment setup.

2.  **Task: Add a "Provider Settings" UI.**
    *   **Action**: Leverage the existing `SettingsModal.tsx` in the `web-poc`. Add a new section for "LLM Provider". This section should include input fields for Base URL and API Key, specifically targeting the `LmStudio` provider, as it is already implemented and ideal for local development.
    *   **Rationale**: Provides a user-friendly way for developers to configure the connection to their local LLM.

### Phase 2: Bridge the POC Configuration to the Core Logic

1.  **Task: Adapt the LLM Manager.**
    *   **Action**: Modify the `getChatModelClient` function (in `src/core/llm/manager.ts`) or the providers themselves (e.g., `src/core/llm/lmStudioProvider.ts`). The logic must be updated to check if it's running in the POC environment. If so, it should use the credentials from our new `poc-settings.ts` store instead of the plugin's standard settings.
    *   **Rationale**: This is the critical link that injects the POC-specific configuration into the shared, core chat logic.

2.  **Task: Provide Clear Developer Guidance.**
    *   **Action**: Add a section to the `DEVELOPMENT.md` or a `README.md` in the `web-poc` directory explaining how to download and run a local LLM server (like LM Studio) and how to configure the POC to connect to it via the new settings UI.
    *   **Rationale**: Ensures that any developer can get the interactive POC running quickly, which is essential for productivity and testing.

### Phase 3: Validate the End-to-End Chat Workflow

1.  **Task: Perform a Full-System Test.**
    *   **Action**: With a local LLM running and the `web-poc` configured to point to it, execute the primary test case:
        1.  Open the chat view.
        2.  Type a message and mention `@Welcome.md`.
        3.  Send the message.
    *   **Rationale**: This is the final validation that all the new pieces are working together correctly.

2.  **Task: Verify Success Conditions.**
    *   **Action**: Confirm the following outcomes:
        *   **NO** `ErrorModal` appears.
        *   The developer console for the browser shows a successful network request to the local LLM.
        *   A new assistant message appears in the `ChatView` with a streamed response from the LLM.
    *   **Rationale**: Provides definitive proof that the API unstubbing is complete and the chat feature is fully functional.
